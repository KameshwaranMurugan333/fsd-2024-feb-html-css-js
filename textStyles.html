    <p>While addressing the media on Monday, Mumbai Indians coach Mark Bouhcer hinted that Suryakumar could miss a few
        games. "We are awaiting updates on Suryakumar from the BCCI. We have always been under a cloud of fitness issues
        but
        we have a world-class medical team. We may lose one or two in terms of fitness but we have to move on," Boucher
        said.</p>
